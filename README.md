Reproduce simply layout with using sass compilator ðŸŽ¯

## General information ðŸ“š

Work on the project begun with building an enviroment using Vite and creating simply file struckture compatible with 'Sass'.
The layout contains two sections: header with logo & navigation, and main section containing a description and form. 
Project has limited width, this was achieved using a container. For the positioning of the elements I've used: 'Flex'.
Variables were used to organize the code, as well a loop the specifies the class along with the font weight.
Icons from 'FontAwesome" was added using 'unicode' and 'pseudoelements'.
